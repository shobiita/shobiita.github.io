        <!--The first step in the experiment was using Adobe Illustrator to view the bare bone elements I needed to create. After establshing a visual spatial layout of the boxes required for the experiment, I began writing the HTML/CSS code for the each individual seven boxes.The layout reference I chose for this Assignment was the Katsuhiro Otomo - Akira Vol.1 page 167.-->

This made it difficult to begin the actual assignment as I had floating boxes everywhere. To resolve this issue, I read each reading provided on Canvas Modules to understand the concept of the code from start to finish, this additionally helped me solve the issue and start the actual establishment of the boxes.-->
