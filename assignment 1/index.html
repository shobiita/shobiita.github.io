          For this Assignment we were assigned to research an interactive media of our choice. I decided to explore the interactional experience in the website <a href="https://orb.farm/" style="color:#633785" >orb.farm</a>
       <br>
       <br>
       <br>
       <br>
          <div class="orb">

      <div style="color: rgb(46, 3, 56);font-weight: 200; font-style: italic; text-align:center;font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
        <p>1) Spend two minutes with the experience and list all of your actions in granular detail. </p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
     <div style="color: #ae9abd; text-align:left; font-size: 17px;">
      <ul>
        <div class="orby">
          <img src="img/orby.png" id="orby" style="float:right" >
        </div>
<li>I opened the website and viewed an empty globe with a sunset-like background there is a box with different elements located on the top right-hand side.</li> 

<li>I began to fill up my Globe using my first selected element of water</li> 

<li>I moved my cursor to the elements tab, clicked on the ‘water’ button and then began moving horizontally left and right while holding down the left side of my mouse. The water began to fall in the direction the cursor was moving</li> 

<li>After putting the designated amount of water in I moved my cursor back to the elements tab this time clicking on the ‘sand’ button, with the same method I moved my cursor left and right filling in any gaps</li> 

<li>Since I wanted to place some sea life I went back to the elements bar clicking the ‘fish’ tab, this time I didn't need to move horizontally to place the fish, I could just scroll wherever inside the globe and left-click to add a fish. </li> 

<li>After the fish, I added goldfish using the same set of interactions.</li> 

<li>Additionally, I also added some grass by going back to the elements bar and clicking on ‘grass’. I had to hold and move my cursor horizontally to place the grass </li> 

<li>I also added some daphnia, I didn't know what this was so I added a bunch by holding and dragging my mouse left and right. </li> 

<li>During the time I had remaining, I went back to the navigation bar located on the top right and then clicked on the fast forward button</li> 

<li>Once the button was clicked, at 2x speed the ecosystem that I had created rapidly began to flourish and develop</li> 

<li>I had noticed the daphnias which I placed at the end had drowned to the bottom and turned pink</li> 

<li>As the ecosystem was developing at 2x speed, the fish began to rapidly go in multiple directions with no sense of control</li> 

<li>I clicked on the fast forward button again and the development stopped on the section it was in</li> 
</ul></div>
 <br>
 <div style="color: rgb(46, 3, 56);font-weight: 200; font-style: italic; text-align:center;font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">
  <p> 2) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience? </p>
 </div>
  
 <div style="color: #ae9abd; text-align:left; font-size: 17px; text-align: left;">
  <div class="cursor">
    <img src="img/cursor.png" id="cursor" style="float:left" >
  </div>
  <p>The first thing that caught my attention during my interactions with the experience 
    was that if you wanted to insert any element you had to click on the cursor every time. 
    Additionally, it also caught my eye that when I had an element clicked on and was moving my cursor horizontally to apply the element, the remains 
    that weren't inside the globe ended up disappearing and exiting through the sites. 
    In short, what entered the globe stayed in the ecosystem and the elements that escaped the globe weren't visible.

 <div style="color: rgb(46, 3, 56);font-weight: 200; font-style: italic; text-align:center;font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">
  <p> 3) What did you spend the most time engaging with? </p>
 </div>
 <div style="color: #ae9abd; text-align:left; font-size: 17px; text-align: left;">
<p>During my 2 minute experience, I spent the most time engaging through building the ecosystem with different functions given. With the use of multiple elements and different scrolling and cursor methods, I was able to establish the ecosystem I desired with the use of the elements provided.
  </p> 
 </div>

 <div style="color: rgb(46, 3, 56);font-weight: 200; font-style: italic; text-align:center;font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">
  <p> 4) What was the most common action in your two-minute interaction with the experience? </p>
 </div>
 <div style="color: #ae9abd; text-align:left; font-size: 17px; text-align: left;">
  <p>The most common action in my two minutes of interaction was holding and dragging the cursor in various directions. The main focus of this experience was to build an ecosystem and the only way to do that was by holding and dragging multiple elements

    </p> 
   </div>

  <p> 5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience? </p>
 </div>
 <div style="color: #ae9abd; text-align:left; font-size: 17px; text-align: left;">
  <p>The primary goal of this web experience is to understand the cause and effect factors that happen when you create and develop an ecosystem. This experience was enabled to make the users realise that minor or vast changes in the environment can impact the ecosystem in the long term. Allowing us to fast forward our environment illustrates that the creator wanted us to view the outcome of our created environment in different periods.
    </p> 
   </div>

 <div style="color: rgb(46, 3, 56);font-weight: 200; font-style: italic; text-align:center;font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">
  <p>  6) How does the experience communicate its primary goal?  </p>
 </div>
 <div style="color: #ae9abd; text-align:left; font-size: 17px; text-align: left;">
  <p> 
    The interactive experience demonstrates the primary goal of the creation and development stages of an environment, and its alterations due to the nature of cause and effect are viewed through the selection and drag or drop system. The Drag and drop system allows users to control how much or little they wish to apply a certain element in their ecosystem. The different types of elements provided range from woods to earth elements and sealife, everything that makes up our ecosystem is a place and the globe in the middle which I presume is a reflection of the world is only filled with certain element that enters the globe. By the users being given options to select whatever they desire and to however much quantity, the ecosystem is self-created, meaning some elements that we want to see together probably will clash, hence meeting its primary goal.    
    </p> 
   </div>

 <div style="color: rgb(46, 3, 56);font-weight: 200; font-style: italic; text-align:center;font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">
  <p>  
    7) What is your impression of the intended length of a single interaction and how often you are intended to interact with the experience?
    </p>
 </div>
 <div style="color: #ae9abd; text-align:left; font-size: 17px; text-align: left;">
  <p>Personally, this was an enjoyable experience that had a satisfactory length of a single interaction. Though repetitive as I was using the same interaction over and over again, each time I had the control to go into the depths of my outcome.  With this experience focused on building and developing over just a straight one-stop interaction, I presume was are intended to interact with the experience however many times as possible to suit our standards of needs. And as stated before since it represents an ecosystem, which is an endless cycle, meaning the virtual ecosystem in the globe would require careful decision-making and approximate the right level of element placement in the globe. Since the main interaction is to hold and scrolls in either direction, depending on what you choose and how many time u choose to apply it the duration of the interaction is increased based on your control.

  <p> 8) What metaphor or metaphors does the experience's mental model reference?
  </p>
 </div>
 <div style="color: #ae9abd; text-align:left; font-size: 17px; text-align: left;">
  <p>Orb Farm’s mental model references the idea of having the control to create an ecosystem and fill it up with elements of our choice. The globe, located in the middle of the website, is perceived as the centre of the world. By users being able to 'fill up the world' with any elements of their choice within the ecosystem, they can create a world that's either positively or negatively impacted. From my perspective, in real life we don't have much control over our environment, yes we can make conscious choices and act in a certain manner towards our ecosystem. However, physically we aren't able to develop an ecosystem of our own by picking and choosing the elements we want to keep and add to the world. Since 'our ecosystem is a business, we can't just fill it up without constructing a distinct plan of operation, or it will fail.
    </p>

  <p>9) What does this reference suggest about how you should feel and/or act when engaging with it? </p>
 </div>
 <div style="color: #ae9abd; text-align:left; font-size: 17px; text-align: left;">
  <p>This website illustrates a homey atmosphere in which users are aimed to take precautions when dealing with elements. Since climate change and the ecosystem have been getting worse over the years, this experience is an awakening to ensure that though not visible, changes are still occurring. However, the visual elements of this website do overlook the seriousness of the subject they are trying to address. The pixelated, child-like layout makes it feel like a video game in which you have a sense of freedom to develop whatever ecosystem you want. With this sense of freedom, users may take it light-heartedly, corresponding to the initial nature of the media. Though the Orb Farm did bring attention to the rapid changes in the atmosphere, the delivery was unsuccessful.

  <p> 10) What is the most frustrating element of the interaction and what makes it frustrating to you?
  </p>
 </div>
 <div style="color: #ae9abd; text-align:left; font-size: 17px; text-align: left;">
  <p>The most frustrating interaction was the 'fast-forward' interaction in which you could view the atmosphere and its development over time at 2x speed. Personally, the duration of Orb Farm's ecosystem when it is unsuccessful involves many elements clashing, ruining the atmosphere of the whole experience, which was previously healing and calm. During the fast forward motion where you could see the development of the ecosystem, the daphnia I added ended up spreading to the bottom, transforming to a different colour, whilst the fishes I placed were hyperactive, going everywhere. To me, this was both unflattering and chaotic.

  <p>11) What is the most satisfying element of the interaction and what makes it satisfying to you?
  </p>
 </div>
 <div style="color: #c2b0cf; text-align:left; font-size: 17px; text-align: left;">
  <p>The most satisfying element of the interactive media is being able to control everything: the number and quantity of components, their placement, as well as the process of being able to watch the substances go down the globe. Specifically, the process of monitoring the selected elements descends to the positions you dragged them to, I found it stress-reliving and calming, resembling how an ecosystem should be.
